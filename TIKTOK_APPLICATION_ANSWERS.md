## Research Project Information

**Project Title:**
```
Using Social Media Analytics to Strengthen Civic Engagement in Haiti: A Machine Learning Approach to Citizenship Development
```

**Project Description:** (Copy-paste this)
```
This research examines how social media influencers and machine learning can be used to promote civic engagement among Haitian youth. The study will analyze content performance, engagement patterns, and sentiment on TikTok to understand what messaging resonates with Haitian audiences regarding citizenship, voting, community service, and anti-corruption activism.

The research is part of Ayiti Sitwayen (Haitian Citizens), a 24-month campaign to engage 3 million Haitians in active citizenship through social media platforms. Using TikTok's Research API, we will:

1) Identify Haiti-based influencers reaching civic-minded audiences
2) Analyze which content formats and themes drive civic engagement
3) Measure sentiment toward citizenship topics in Haitian Creole and French
4) Develop machine learning models to optimize civic messaging
5) Create replicable methodologies for civic tech in developing democracies

This research serves the public interest by strengthening democratic participation in Haiti (UN SDG 16), providing data-driven insights for civil society organizations, and contributing to academic literature on social media's role in fragile democracies.

Project website: https://ayitisitwayen.org
```

**Research Questions:**
```
1. What types of social media content (video formats, themes, messaging) drive civic engagement among Haitian youth on TikTok?

2. Which content creators (influencers) have the greatest impact on civic attitudes and behaviors among Haitian audiences?

3. How does sentiment toward citizenship topics (voting, anti-corruption, community service) vary across demographics (age, gender, location)?

4. Can machine learning algorithms predict which content will generate measurable civic action (shares, comments expressing civic intent, documented participation)?

5. What are the linguistic and cultural factors that make civic messaging effective in Haitian Creole versus French?
```

**Methodology:**
```
Mixed-methods approach combining quantitative and qualitative analysis:

QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS:
- Collection of engagement metrics (views, likes, comments, shares) for Haiti-focused civic content
- Social network analysis to identify influential nodes and information diffusion patterns
- Time-series analysis of civic engagement trends
- A/B testing of different content formats and messaging strategies

MACHINE LEARNING:
- Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models for engagement prediction
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks for virality forecasting
- K-Means clustering for audience segmentation
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) for sentiment analysis in Haitian Creole and French
- Multilingual BERT (mBERT) fine-tuned on Haitian linguistic data

QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS:
- Content analysis of user-generated comments
- Thematic coding of civic discourse
- Case studies of high-performing civic content

VALIDATION:
- Cross-validation with offline civic participation data
- Survey research (n=3,000) to validate social media insights
- Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) comparing exposed vs. non-exposed groups
```

**Expected Outcomes and Deliverables:**
```
ACADEMIC OUTPUTS:
1. Research paper for peer-reviewed journal: "Social Media for Civic Engagement in Fragile States: Evidence from Haiti"
2. Conference presentations at digital democracy and computational social science conferences
3. Public dataset (anonymized) for other researchers studying civic tech in developing countries

TECHNICAL OUTPUTS:
4. Database of 500+ Haiti-focused influencers with detailed engagement metrics
5. Machine learning model predicting civic content performance (target: 80%+ accuracy)
6. Sentiment analysis dashboard for real-time monitoring of civic topics in Haitian Creole
7. Open-source toolkit for replicating methodology in other contexts

PRACTICAL OUTPUTS:
8. Evidence-based guidelines for civic organizations using social media in Haiti
9. Training materials for Haitian civil society on digital civic engagement
10. Policy brief for Haitian government and international donors on youth civic participation

All research findings will be made publicly available to maximize social impact.
```

**How does this research serve the public interest?**
```
This research serves the public interest in five key ways:

1. STRENGTHENING DEMOCRACY IN HAITI
Haiti faces a severe civic crisis: 20% voter turnout (one of the world's lowest), 18/100 corruption perception score, and widespread political disengagement. This research provides evidence-based strategies to rebuild civic culture using platforms where 87% of Haitians already engage (mobile/social media).

2. ADVANCING UN SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOAL 16
SDG 16 (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions) requires participatory decision-making and accountable governance. This research directly contributes to SDG 16.7 (ensuring responsive, inclusive, participatory decision-making) by understanding how digital tools can strengthen citizen voice.

3. CREATING PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE
All research findings, datasets (anonymized), and tools will be published openly for use by:
- Academic researchers studying digital democracy
- Civil society organizations working on civic engagement
- Policymakers designing youth participation programs
- Other fragile democracies seeking to rebuild civic culture

4. DEVELOPING REPLICABLE METHODS
While focused on Haiti, this research creates methodologies applicable to 50+ countries facing similar challenges (low civic engagement, young populations, high mobile penetration, fragile democratic institutions). By documenting what works, we enable replication across the Global South.

5. EMPOWERING MARGINALIZED VOICES
Traditional civic education excludes Haiti's majority: rural populations, Creole speakers, low-literacy communities. Social media-based approaches meet people where they are, in their language, using culturally resonant formats. This research ensures these methods are evidence-based and effective.

The research is non-commercial, non-partisan, and designed to serve Haiti's long-term democratic development.
