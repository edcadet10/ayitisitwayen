### Technical Setup Testing

**Filming Checklist:**

**Before Each Interview:**
- [ ] Phone fully charged

- [ ] Subject fills 2/3 of frame (not too far, not too close)
- [ ] Slight headroom (space above head)
- [ ] Background interesting but not distracting
- [ ] Light source in front of/to side of subject (not behind - backlit is bad)

**Audio:**
- [ ] Stand 3-4 feet away (close enough for good audio)

# 3. PRODUCTION WORKFLOW

## Filming Session Protocol

### Pre-Interview (5 minutes per person)

**Approach Script (Creole):**

```
Bonjou/Bonswa!

Mwen rele [Your Name]. M ap travay ak yon pwojè ki rele "Ayiti Sitwayen."
N ap mande Ayisyen - moun tankou ou - kisa sitwayen vle di pou yo.

Èske ou gen 5-10 minit pou pale avè m sou sa?

[If yes:]
Mèsi anpil! N ap filme sa pou mete sou TikTok, Instagram, ak Facebook.
Se pou montre vwa pèp la. Èske sa bon pou ou?

[If yes:]
Pafè! Kòmanse. Pa enkyete w, pa gen repons ki mal. Jis pale de kè ou.
```

**English Translation:**
```
Hello!

My name is [Your Name]. I'm working on a project called "Ayiti Sitwayen" (Haitian Citizens).
We're asking Haitians - people like you - what citizenship means to them.

Do you have 5-10 minutes to talk with me about this?

[If yes:]
Thank you! We'll film this for TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook.
It's to show the voice of the Haitian people. Is that okay with you?

[If yes:]
Perfect! Let's start. Don't worry, there are no wrong answers. Just speak from your heart.
```

### During Interview (10-15 minutes)

**Filming Technique:**

1. **Position yourself:**
   - Face person directly
   - Phone at their eye level
   - 3-4 feet away (arm's length + a bit more)

2. **Frame the shot:**
   - Person centered or slightly off-center
   - Chest and head in frame (not full body)
   - Interesting background (Haiti street life)
   - Check: Is lighting good on their face?

3. **Ask questions:**
   - You can be heard asking questions (adds authenticity) OR
   - Just film their answers (edit out your voice)
   - Test both styles, see what works

4. **Let them talk:**
   - Don't interrupt mid-thought
   - Nod and react (shows you're listening)
   - If they pause, wait 3 seconds before next question (they might add more)

5. **Get multiple takes:**
   - If answer is good but noisy (car honking), ask them to repeat
   - "Sa te bon anpil! Èske ou ka di l ankò?" (That was great! Can you say it again?)

### Post-Interview (2 minutes)

**Closing Script (Creole):**
```
Mèsi anpil pou tan ou!

Video a pral soti nan kont @ayitisitwayen sou TikTok ak Instagram.
M ap pataje li ak ou tou.

Èske ou gen zanmi oswa fanmi ki ta vle pataje istwa yo tou?
[Get referrals]

Mèsi ankò! Kenbe fèm! 🇭🇹
```

**Ask for:**
- Their first name (confirm spelling)
- Neighborhood/city
- Optional: Phone number to send them the video link
- Referrals to other people

### Backup & Organization

**Immediately After Filming:**
1. Review footage - did anything go wrong?
2. If so, re-film while still there
3. Upload to Google Drive (backup)
4. Label file: `Date_Location_Name` (ex: `2024-12-15_Petion-Ville_Jean`)

**End of Day:**
- Charge phone
- Delete blurry/unusable clips to free space
- Update tracking sheet (see below)

# 5. DISTRIBUTION & ENGAGEMENT

## Posting Schedule

### Optimal Posting Times (Haiti Time - EST)

**TikTok/Instagram:**
- **Best:** 6-8pm (after work/school, people scrolling)
- **Good:** 12-1pm (lunch break)
- **Good:** 9-11pm (before bed)

**Facebook:**
- **Best:** 7-9am (morning scroll)
- **Good:** 12-1pm (lunch)
- **Good:** 7-9pm (evening)

### Weekly Publishing Rhythm

**Week 1 Example:**
- Monday 7pm: Video 1 (TikTok, Instagram, Facebook simultaneously)
- Wednesday 7pm: Video 2
- Friday 7pm: Video 3

**Consistency > Frequency**
Better to post 2x/week consistently than 5x one week and 0 the next

### Multi-Platform Strategy

**TikTok (PRIMARY):**
- Post first here (algorithm favors fresh content)
- Use all TikTok features: captions, hashtags, location tag, question sticker
- Engage with Haiti TikTok community (comment on other Haiti content)

**Instagram Reels:**
- Post 30-60 min after TikTok
- Cross-post but optimize caption for Instagram audience
- Use Instagram Stories to promote Reels ("New interview up! See reel")

**Facebook:**
- Post 1-2 hours after TikTok
- Longer captions work better here (add context)
- Share to relevant Haitian community groups (with permission)
- Tag location (helps local discovery)

**YouTube Shorts:**
- Upload once a week (batch upload 3-4 videos)
- Use same videos, optimized descriptions
- Build archive for long-term discovery

---

## Engagement Strategy

### Responding to Comments

**Within First Hour:**
- Reply to first 5-10 comments (boosts algorithm)
- Ask follow-up questions
- Heart genuine responses

**Daily:**
- Check all comments
- Reply to questions
- Thank people for sharing their stories

**Comment Reply Templates:**

**When someone shares their perspective:**

```
(Thank you for sharing! Your perspective is important. Would you like to participate in an interview? DM us!)

**When someone asks a question:**
```
Bèl kesyon! [Answer]. Ki sa ou panse?
```
(Great question! [Answer]. What do you think?)

**When someone disagrees:**
```
Nou respekte opinyon ou. Se sa ki bèl ak demokrasi - divèsite panse! 💬
```
(We respect your opinion. That's what's beautiful about democracy - diversity of thought!)

### Community Building Tactics

**1. Spotlight Commenters:**

# 9. TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

## Common Problems & Solutions

### Problem 1: People Refuse to Be Interviewed

**Possible Reasons:**
- Don't understand the project
- Camera shy
- Suspicious of your intentions
- Too busy

**Solutions:**
✅ **Explain clearly:** Show them previous videos on your phone
✅ **Start with people who know you:** Friends, family, neighbors build credibility
✅ **Offer anonymity:** "We can blur your face" or "Just use your voice"
✅ **Respect refusals:** "Mèsi kanmenm! Bonne journée!"
✅ **Build local trust:** Interview in same location regularly, people will see others doing it

---

### Problem 2: Videos Getting Low Views

**Possible Causes:**
- Algorithm not picking up your content
- Posting at wrong times
- Content not resonating
- Not using right hashtags

**Solutions:**
✅ **Check analytics:** What's your average watch time? (Should be >40%)
✅ **Experiment with hooks:** First 3 seconds CRITICAL - start with most interesting part
✅ **Improve captions:** Make them readable, accurate, engaging
✅ **Use trending sounds:** When relevant to Haiti/citizenship
✅ **Engage more:** Comment on other Haiti content, algorithm notices
✅ **Be patient:** First 10-20 videos are "algorithm training" - it learns your niche

**Quick Win Tactics:**
- Post at 7-8pm (prime scrolling time)
- Use text overlay highlighting best quote
- Make thumbnails visually interesting
- End with question (increases comments)

---

### Problem 3: Negative/Trolling Comments

**Types You'll Encounter:**
- Political attacks
- Diaspora vs. Haiti residents tension
- Language purists (Creole vs. French)
- Cynicism about Haiti's future

**Response Strategy:**

**For Constructive Disagreement:**
```
Mèsi pou pataje opinyon ou. Nou respekte divèsite panse. 🇭🇹
```

**For Trolling/Attacks:**
- Don't engage
- Hide/delete if hateful
- Block repeat offenders
- Never argue in comments

**For Political Bait:**
```
Pwojè sa a pa politik. Li konsène tout Ayisyen. Nou pa sipòte okenn pati.
```

---

### Problem 4: Running Out of People to Interview

**Solutions:**

✅ **Expand locations:** New neighborhoods, new cities
✅ **Visit events:** Markets, church, community gatherings, cultural events
✅ **Ask for referrals:** "Èske ou konnen yon lòt moun ki ta renmen pataje istwa yo?"
✅ **Partner with organizations:** They can introduce you to their communities
✅ **Revisit topics:** Same location, new question = new pool of people
✅ **Different times of day:** Different people (morning market vendors vs. evening customers)

---

### Problem 5: Inconsistent Posting (Falling Behind)

**Causes:**
- Life happens
- Editing takes too long
- Film less than planned

**Solutions:**

✅ **Batch film:** Film 6-8 interviews in one session (90 minutes)
✅ **Bank content:** Always have 2-3 edited videos ready to post
✅ **Simplify editing:** Not every video needs fancy effects
✅ **Set realistic goals:** 2x/week is better than planning 5x and doing 0
✅ **Use templates:** Save your editing templates in CapCut (speeds up process)
✅ **Schedule posts:** Use TikTok's "Schedule" feature to auto-post

**Emergency Plan (When Busy):**
- Post 1x/week minimum (keeps algorithm happy)
- Use "compilation" format (less editing)
- Share behind-the-scenes content (easier to create)
- Communicate: "Nou ap tounen semenn pwochèn! 🔜"

---

### Problem 6: Equipment Failure

**Phone Broken/Lost:**
- Backup: Borrow phone from friend/family
- Cloud storage: Always upload raw footage to Google Drive
- Continue: Audio-only interviews if no camera (podcast style)

**Low Storage:**
- Delete old videos after uploading to cloud
- Use Google Photos to backup/delete phone photos
- Get cheap SD card or USB OTG adapter

**Battery Dies Mid-Interview:**
- Always carry portable charger
- Film in batches (don't drain battery)
- Have backup: film with friend's phone

**Process:**

**Why This Works:**
- Scales without you traveling everywhere
- Builds capacity in Haiti
- Creates jobs/skills for young people
- More content, less work for you

---

## Monetization (Month 12+)

- "Support our work" campaigns

**Grant Funding:**
